# Pycon - Friday, April 29

## Opening Keynote

Main takeaways

- I should be actively adding typing to more code I write
  - Maybe note for mypi integration (yet), but because it's low overhead tooling to help improve self-documenting code
  - If something is hard to type, you probably need to refactor it

- I need to focus more on single type outputs of functions, if it's impossible to output something of that type, an exception is reasonable
